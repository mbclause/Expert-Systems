# 🧠 Expert Systems Projects – CPSC 583

This repository contains homework and project materials from the Expert Systems course at California State University, Fullerton. It includes both written assignments and an original expert system implemented in **CLIPS**.

### 📝 Homework Assignments
PDFs summarizing conceptual and applied understanding of expert systems:
- `Michael Clausen-Homework 1.pdf`
- `Michael_Clausen_Homework_2.pdf`
- `Michael Clausen HW3.pdf`
- `Michael Clausen Homework 4.pdf`

These documents cover topics such as rule-based reasoning, production systems, conflict resolution strategies, certainty factors, and inference engines.

### 🧪 CLIPS Project – Inference Rule System
*Folder: `CPSC-583-Project-main`*

Contains two versions of a custom rule-based expert system written in **CLIPS**:

- `version1.clp`
- `version2.clp`

These are early-stage versions of a rule-based inference engine designed to model decision logic based on user input and predefined facts. They serve as a demonstration of forward-chaining, fact assertion, and rule evaluation.

⚠️ **Note on Limitations:**
The CLIPS project is partially functional and may exhibit inconsistent behavior:
- Some rules may not trigger as expected due to ordering or matching issues.
- The logic and structure may not fully conform to best practices for modular CLIPS program design.
- Both versions are included for reference, but neither is fully production-ready.

📄 See `CPSC-583-Project-main/README.md` for project-specific notes.
